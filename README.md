## Description
1. The drone which has 2 DoF, is controlled by creating a tracking system, regulator, and observer algorithms. If this drone trajectory is accepted in the xy plane, there are some blocks on its path and it needs to move to +y and -y directions while moving in +x direction. The mass center of the drone is described as a C point and the CD link is rigidly connected to the mass center. This link has the length as h. ùêπùê∑ùë• and ùêπùê∑ùë¶ are external disturbances. The moment of inertia around the mass center is I. X and Y representation of the position of the drone. External forces are given from the end point of the rigid link CD. (Fig. 2)
2. Equations of motion of the drone are given in Figure 4.
3. For linearization, state and input vectors are given in Figure 5.
4. Regulator design is made by Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) Algorithm.
5. Observer design can be seen in .m file.
6. I used Simulink 3D Animation Toolbox for the visualization of the system.

## Installation
> 1. Download 2R folder, 5Bar_m_.m and 5bar_Sim.slx files.
> 2. Put these files into your MATLAB folder which is located in Documents.
> 3. Open the .m file and Simulink model. Then evaluate the first section of .m file.
> 4. Play Simulink model and you will see the Simscape model.
> 5. The end-effector of the mechanism will be controlled by your mouse.
> 6. Enjoy!
